Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

For state of the art Computer Vision training notebooks you can use with this dataset,

The dataset includes 6335 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 29 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -20 and +20 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -14째 to +14째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -24 and +24 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels
