# Dog-Emotion-Detection Dataset Training
This repository contains a custom object detection model trained to classify 5 dog emotions â€” **Happy**, **Alert**, **Frown**, **Relax**, and **Angry** â€” using the **YOLOv11** model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). The dataset was annotated using **Roboflow** and formatted to work seamlessly with YOLOv11.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation

Dogs communicate their emotions through subtle facial cues and body language. However, recognizing these emotional states is often subjective and difficult for humans. This project aims to:

- Build an **AI-powered tool** to automatically detect and classify common dog emotions.
- Support **pet owners, trainers, and veterinarians** in better understanding canine behavior.
- Lay the foundation for **future emotion-to-voice translation systems**.
