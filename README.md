# Dog-Emotion-Detection-using-YOLOv11
This repository contains a custom object detection model trained to classify 5 dog emotions — **Happy**, **Alert**, **Frown**, **Relax**, and **Angry** — using the **YOLOv11** model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). The dataset was annotated using **Roboflow** and formatted to work seamlessly with YOLOv11.
