# Dog-Emotion-Detection-using-YOLOv11
This repository contains a custom object detection model trained to classify 5 dog emotions â€” **Happy**, **Alert**, **Frown**, **Relax**, and **Angry** â€” using the **YOLOv11** model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). The dataset was annotated using **Roboflow** and formatted to work seamlessly with YOLOv11.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation

Dogs communicate their emotions through subtle facial cues and body language. However, recognizing these emotional states is often subjective and difficult for humans. This project aims to:

- Build an **AI-powered tool** to automatically detect and classify common dog emotions.
- Support **pet owners, trainers, and veterinarians** in better understanding canine behavior.
- Lay the foundation for **future emotion-to-voice translation systems**.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Structure

The dataset was annotated and exported from **Roboflow** in YOLO format.

Getting Started
1. Install Ultralytics
bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics

3. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-emotion-yolov11.git
cd dog-emotion-yolov11

5. Train the Model
bash
Copy code
yolo train model=yolov11n.pt data=dataset/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640 batch=16
Replace yolov11n.pt with other variants like yolov11s.pt, yolov11m.pt as needed based on hardware capacity.

6. Run Inference
bash
Copy code
yolo detect model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=path/to/image_or_video
