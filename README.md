# 🐶 Dog Emotion Detection — YOLOv11 Model

This repository contains a custom object detection model trained to classify five distinct dog emotions: Happy, Alert, Frown, Relax, and Angry, utilizing the state-of-the-art YOLOv11 architecture from Ultralytics. The dataset was meticulously annotated via Roboflow and prepared in a format fully compatible with YOLOv11 training pipelines.

### 🚀 Project Overview
Understanding canine emotions through facial expressions and body language remains a challenge for many pet owners, trainers, and veterinary professionals. This project was developed with the following goals:

✅ Develop an AI-driven system to automatically detect and classify common dog emotional states.

✅ Assist pet owners, trainers, behaviorists, and veterinarians in interpreting dog behavior with greater accuracy.

✅ Provide a robust foundation for future AI-based emotion-to-voice translation platforms for companion animals.
